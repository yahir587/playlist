# Playlist Project

## Overview:
In this unit, coders will create a Playlist. The Playlist will display a list of information about different songs with images and links to play the songs. To create this project, coders will create arrays to hold song information, use a for of loop to iterate over the arrays, and display data to the screen. They will use .push to add new songs to their playlist. Then, students will refactor their project to using objects instead of arrays to hold their data.

## Day 1

## Day 1 Goal 1: Set Up
#### Planning
- [ ] Complete the project planning document.
#### GitHub Set-Up
- [x] Go to the repository
- [ ] Fork this repository to your github account and import to a new workspace
- [ ] Submit your website using the link on the Agenda

### Day 1 Goal 2: Write the code to store your song titles
- [ ] In your HTML, create a div to display your songs
- [ ] In your JS, create and populate an array to store your song names

### Day 1 Goal 3: Write the code to store the rest of your song information
- [ ] In your HTML, create divs to display your song artists, song lengths, images, and links.
- [ ] In your JS, create and populate arrays to store your song artists, song lengths, images, and links.

#### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!

## Day 2

### Day 2 Goal 1: Write the code to display your song titles on the page
- [ ] Create a loop that loops through your song name array and displays your song names in the correct div

### Day 2 Goal 2: Write the code to display the rest of your song information
- [ ] Create loops that loop through your song artists, song lengths, images, and links arrays and display the information in the correct divs.

#### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!

## Day 3

### Day 3 Goal 1: Write the code to allow users to add additional songs to your playlist
- [ ] In HTML, add an input tag and button so your user can add a song title to your playlist
- [ ] In JS, create a working click handler that retrieves user input when it is submitted.
- [ ] Inside your click handler, use `.push()` to add the input value to your song name array.
- [ ] Inside your click handler, use `.empty()` to make sure your song names display on the page correctly.

### Day 3 Goal 2: Write the code to allow users to add additional song information to your playlist
- [ ] In HTML, add more input tags so your user can add the rest of the song information
- [ ] Inside your click handler, retrieve all the user input
- [ ] Use `.push()` to add the input value to your song name array.
- [ ] Use `.empty()` to make sure your song information displays on the page correctly.

#### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!

## Day 4

### Day 4 Goal 1: Refactor your arrays so all your song information is stored in Objects
- [ ] Comment out your arrays
- [ ] Create an Object for each of your songs
- [ ] Inside each Object, add key/value pairs to store the title, artist, song length, image, and link
- [ ] Store all your Objects in one array

#### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!


## Day 5

### Day 5 Goal 1: Refactor your loops so all your song information displays correctly on the page
- [ ] Update your click handler so the input values are saved in as values in a new Object
- [ ] Update your `.push()` so the input Object is added to your array of Objects
- [ ] Update your loops based on your new array of Objects

#### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!

## Project Extensions:
- [ ] Add in your own CSS to personalize your project
- [ ] Use .length to display how many songs are on your list
- [ ] Add a delete button to delete songs on your list
- [ ] Refactor your project further by utilizing functions to simplify your code
- [ ] Add a shuffle button and functionality
- [ ] Use local storage to save your songs locally
